## ProcAID Stage Two 

ProcAID stands for "Process Anomaly-based Intrusion Detection." The capability is made of two stages: 

1. Stage One: Unsupervised link prediction on a process creation log graph 
2. Stage Two: Inverse leadership and inverse density analysis  

The full explanation of ProcAID can be found here [ProcAID](https://www.proquest.com/openview/e4ce5ff777fc5943a8b4624677b3cad1/1.pdf?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y).

For convenience and use-case purposes, this repository contains the framework and algorithm to run Stage Two of ProcAID. Stage One can be found here [ProcAID Stage One](https://github.com/ajread4/procaid_stage1).
